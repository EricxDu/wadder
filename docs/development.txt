# Development

Wadder is a versatile Python module that can perform a variety of WAD 
data manipulations.

"wadder.py" is the original, stand-alone script. It will be kept for
historical purposes. Most of Wadder's functionality is being moved into
the 'xwadder' package which provides simple, easy-to-use modules and
classes that interpret WAD and lump data. Scripts in the root directory
contain functions that read WAD and lump data into the objects of
'xwadder' and do perform useful operations in response to simple
commands.

"main.py" works with WAD data, including generic lumps and
Doom-specific lumps. It does not depend on third-party libraries thus
while it can save simple Netpbm files and cannot use Pillow to draw
complex images.

"draw.py" depends on Pillow and is designed to draw 2D representations
of Doom level maps.

# Command-line Behavior

The "main" function of the script should provide command-line access to 
the other functions. This usage is intended for terminal users and 
writers of command scripts and it should print limited amounts of data 
for the user to grep, pipe, save, etc.. Eventually users will be able to 
e.g. filter a list of WAD and save each of their PLAYPAL lumps in a 
separate folder, or save a list of locations and check a series of WAD 
to see what is at that location in each WAD.
