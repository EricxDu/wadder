# Development

Wadder is a versatile Python module that can perform a variety of WAD 
data manipulations. "wadder.py" is the main focus, and all other scripts 
should follow suit.

# Behavior

What each component of Wadder is intended for should be well defined and 
limited so that various users and tools can work with it.

Functions are meant to be called from the Python interpreter or other 
Python modules through imports. They should each return limited amounts 
of WAD data encapsulated in strings, integers, or tuples. Functions 
should avoid printing any data.

The "main" function of the script should provide command-line access to 
the other functions. This usage is intended for terminal users and 
writers of command scripts and it should print limited amounts of data 
for the user to grep, pipe, save, etc.. Eventually users will be able to 
e.g. filter a list of WAD and save each of their PLAYPAL lumps in a 
separate folder, or save a list of locations and check a series of WAD 
to see what is at that location in each WAD.
