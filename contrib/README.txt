This directory contains some Python scripts obtained with permissions 
granted by free software licenses. They are normally used with a source 
file to build a PLAYPAL lump and bootstrap a dummy WAD for use with the 
DeuTEX WAD utility. Since Wadder isn't shipped with any lumps or WAD 
these Python scripts are only here for reference.

The scripts "bootstrap.py" and "playpal.py" were obtained from the 
Freedoom project repository at https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom
